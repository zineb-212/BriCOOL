## Overview
My team and I developed an application named **BriCool**, coded in Java, designed to help users find various local services such as plumbers, electricians, and other tradespeople. The app provides a user-friendly interface where individuals can easily search for service providers in their vicinity. By leveraging location-based services, BriCool efficiently identifies nearby professionals and presents their contact information and ratings. This project not only enhanced our skills in Java programming and mobile app development but also deepened our understanding of integrating location services and creating practical solutions for everyday problems.
